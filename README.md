# DSA-Problems

Hi, all I am looking forward to create a repo with solutions to various DSA problems.
The structure of repo would be
- Topic (Arrays, Tree, DP ... etc)
  - Individual problem
    - Code file(s) (prefered languages c++, java, python) Named as `Solution.cpp` / `Solution.java` / `Solution.py`
    - README.md - Describing the solution (Append solution explanation section to this file)
    
Will upload questions regularly to seek solutions for. Looking forward for participation from you all.

We highly appreciate PR contributions from newbies. The repo is does not need any prior knowledge of development and is specifically designed to get you acquainted with contributing to open source.

Looking forward for an active participation.

Happy Coding;)
